## Introduction

Utilizing the two-dimensional correlation property of batch process impulse response, we propose the amplitude modulated two-dimensional locally stationary kernel by means of addition / multiplication operation based on coordinate decomposition. Then, a nonparametric identification method using two-dimensional kernel-based Gaussian process regression for batch process is developed.
